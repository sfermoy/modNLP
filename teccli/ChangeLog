	* release 0.7.1: Bug-fixing release: fixed subcorpus selection bug
	  (added workaround for empty string elements in header files)
	  (e.g. <name></name>). Added experimental WordleConc plugin as
	  external package (see plugins/ subdirectory)

2011-05-06  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* release 0.7.0: Added supported for  Japanese; incorporated simple
	Japanese tokeniser (indexing now fully functional), adapted word
	splitting for ListDisplay, ListDisplayRenderer and ConcordanceTree
	etc. Fixed minor bugs in ConcordanceThread.java.

2010-07-05  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* release 0.6.2: Upgraded je.jar to version 4. The new index
	format yields considerable performance gains and is about 15% more
	space efficient. The database format changed but the library is
	backward compatible, so clients and indexer using this version
	will be able to access databases created with je version 3. The
	reverse is not true, however. So, dbs created with modnlp-idx >=
	0.1.6 will not be accessible from modnlp-idx <= 0.1.5. 
	Added a brief tutorial.

2009-11-09  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* Browser.java, HeaderXMLHandler.java: fixed parsing of XML
	headers (now displays indented text, without XML tags); fixed
	retrieval of headers on Windows platforms (usse '/' rather that
	java.io.File.separator). Version 0.6.1b

2009-04-30  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* idx, teccli, tecser: New release coincinding with the first
	release of the TEC Corpus (v2). A Corpus description plugin
	(CorpusDescriptionBrowser.java) has been added, many bugs have
	been fixed, the client has been made compatible with JNLP,
	resource files have been created in modnlp/teccli/jnlp.

2008-11-25  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* New release of teccli. Browser has been completely revamped.
	  Legacy code entirely removed; Re-activated plugins; implemented
	  JE-based subcorpus selection to replace SQL server on
	  tec-server; separated GUI from Browser (moved GUI into gui/
	  package); re-implemented ConcArray based on a
	  ('growable') collection class rather than array; fixed
	  scrollbars in ListDisplay (draw list renderers on a
	  ScrollablePane)

2008-10-03  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* FqListBrowser, Dictionary, FreqTable, etc (release 0.5.4): performance
	improvements, a few bug fixes. 

2008-07-18  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* FqListBrowser: Added subcorpus-selection sensitivity

2007-09-21  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* GraphicalSubcorpusSelector, MultipleAttributeSelection,
	AttributeChooser: implemented basic GUI subcorpus selector, fixed
	bugs, tested on HC and CD corpora. Backward compatibility with old
	TEC system has been abadoned as of teccli-0.5.2.

2007-06-25  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* modnlp-idx: Incorporated XMLDB subcospus selection
	functionality (through eXist)

2006-07-20 Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* tec-client (Repository): implemented 'stand-alone' mode,
	accessing local modnlp.idx.database.Dictionary; TecClient renamed
	to Browser; de-activated sub-corpus selection plugin
	
2003-08-06 Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* tec-client (Repository): added simple frequency list plugin and
	  splash screen; fixed minor bugs.

2003-06-22 Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* tec-client (Repository): * Both client and server have been
	revamped. The main changes are:

	o client now requires java 1.3
	
	o The query language has been improved: wildcards are back,
	  sequence queries now work correctly (number of intervening words
	  now mean just that); (take a look at the browser's new help
	  function for a description of the syntax)

	o retrieval efficiency (server side) has been improved: the search
	  engine now chooses the least frequent word to guide the search;

        o Noel's SQL search code (sub-corpus specification) has been
	  cleaned up and fixed (the browser now responds dynamically to
	  server-side changes on the metadata by querying the server at
	  start-up, with the undesirable but unavoidable side-effect of
	  increasing start-up time);

        o the client interface has been improved; new features include menus
          and infrastructure for help files;
    
        o we've move one step closer to a proper plug-in architecture

2001-10-24 Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* INSTALL: Added documentation on how to set up a sample server on
	localhost 

2001-07-31 Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* tec-client (Repository): Changed the client to tunnel all
	connections through HTTP, in order to allow the client to use HTTP
	proxies on machines located behing firewalls. Created code to
	support automatic deployment with Java Web Start (jnlp). Minor bug
	fixes 

2000-07-07 Saturnino Luz  <luzs@acm.org>
	* Added configire, Makefiles etc. Tidied up code.
	  Packed the first release (0.2) of the new client.

2000-04-12 Saturnino Luz  <luzs@acm.org>

        * Started version 0.2. Swing replaces AWT.  New (log time) Merger
	  sort algoritm replaces polynomial-time quicksort algorithm 
	  (...tecclient.TecQSort.java). ListDisplay now has its own 
	  cell renderer ListDisplayRenderer, which highlights keywords,
	  colorizes sort words and other bells and whistles.
