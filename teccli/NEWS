* Both client and server have been revamped. The main changes are:
						     (Jun 2003)

  o The query language has been improved: wildcards are back, sequence
    queries now work correctly (number of intervening words now mean
    just that); (take a look at the browser's new help function for a
    description of the syntax)

  o retrieval efficiency (server side) has been improved: the search
    engine now chooses the least frequent word to guide the search;

  o Noel's SQL search code (sub-corpus specification) has been cleaned
    up and fixed (the browser now responds dynamically to server-side
    changes on the metadata by querying the server at start-up, with
    the undesirable but unavoidable side-effect of increasing start-up
    time); 

  o the client interface has been improved; new features include menus
    and infrastructure for help files;
    
  o we've move one step closer to a proper plug-in architecture

* MySQL support for restricting search to sub-corpora determined by
  author, translator etc added by FYP student Noel Skehan (May 2002)

* GDBM based index replaced WordFarm. Server support for search
  through intervening words added. (Jun 2001)

Old News:

* Java WebStart now used for quick deployment.
