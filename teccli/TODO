* So much to do I don't even know where to start. Here's a
  couple of things that come to mind:

URGENT:

* General rendering for concordances (all languages and fonts)
   Currently the keyword alignment relies on monospaced fonts. This
   works finr for latin alphabets, but breaks down for different
   writing systems (Arabic in particular, which is not even rendered
   properly on the java graphics canvas).  Possible solution:
   Implement a new modnlp.tec.client.gui.ListDisplayRenderer based on
   an HTML component (which should render Arabic correctly) and split
   the component into 3 cells (as in a table); the keyword will be in
   the centre and the contexts on the left and right cells (this
   should solve the alignment issue).

BUG FIXES:

* Find a more principled way to deal with section highlights in
  HeaderXMLHandler. At hte moment it depends on the section being
  called 'section' and the ID attribute being called id. This is too
  ad-hoc, as the idxmgr.properties file allows you to specify any
  section/attribute name you wish.

* Proper treatment of error conditions for new corpus selection (taken
   some initial steps, e.g. handling of ConnectException in
   GraphicalSubcorpusSelector and Browser.setRemoteCorpus() but lots
   more remain to be done)

ENHANCEMENTS:

* implement merging of corpus sources (i.e. the ability to spawn
  several ConcordanceThread's and collate the downloads into a single
  ConcArray for display by a single ListDisplay

* Implement visualisation and direct manipulation plugins (for
  subcorpus selection etc)


DONE:

* Re-activate plugins; implement JE-based subcorpus selection to
  replace SQL server on tec-server

* separate GUI from Browser (move GUI into gui/ package)

* re-implement ConcArray based on a ('growable') collection class
  rather than array

* fix scrollbars in ListDisplay (draw list renderers on a
  ScrollablePane)
