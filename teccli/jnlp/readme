luzs.cer must be added to javaws's list of trusted
certificates in order to avoid 'untrusted certificate' 
warnings. Please check that the data (specially the
certificate fingerprints) match those found in 
my (S. Luz's) web page at 

  http://www.cs.tcd.ie/Saturnino.Luz/

(You can do that via javaws GUI or shell command 
 'keytool -printcert -file luzs.cer')
