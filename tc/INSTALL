To compile the the source for the learner and classifier type

  % make build

If that fails, try

  % ##  compile the learner 
  % ./compile.sh src/modnlp/tc/induction/MakeProbabilityModel.java
  
  % ## compile a (boolean-vector) Bayes classifier
  % ./compile.sh src/modnlp/tc/classify/BVBayes.java                 

If that also fails, you're probably missing a java compiler. You could
try setting variables JAVAC and JAVA in your Makefile to whatever
compiler/interpreter is installed in your machine. 
 
If you're a lucky user of emacs+jdee (http://jdee.sunsite.dk/), prj.el
files are supplied for each subdirectory which enable you to compile,
run and debug straight from emacs.

The command 

  % make test

runs a series of test on tiny corpus, including arff file generation,
term set reduction, induction, classification and evaluation and saves
the results in /tmp/tinycorpus.*

After compilation you can test the programs by doing

  % make test
