- Make Makefile compatible with ../Makefile (i.e. add a rule for java
  compilation and list files explicitly)

- use gnu.getopt to handle our ever increasing set of options. 

- split BVProbabilityModel into two separate classes one extending
  TCProbabilityModel and one implementing TCInvertedIndex

- implement a word-position event probability model (as in Mitchell,
  1997) and a classifier that uses it
