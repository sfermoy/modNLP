modnlp-tecser: TEC SERVER - Concordance server
==============================================

Compile the server by typing

 % make build 

To start the server, first edit lib/server.properties so that
index.dir points to the directory where you keep the index
(see modules-idx): that should normally be the value of
dictionaty.environment.home in dictionaty.properties in the index
directory. Now, change directory to lib and run

java -jar tecser.jar

Sample Unix (SystemV) startup scripts are included which can be
adapted to your server (tecser-sysV-startup.sh for CentOS and 
../bin/tecser-init.d.sh for Debian/Ubuntu).

In order to proxy the concordances etc via an apache webserver, user
reverse proxying, by adding the following to
/etc/httpd/conf/http.conf (for instance):

ProxyRequests Off
ProxyPass /omc-server http://localhost:1245
ProxyPassReverse /omc-server http://localhost:1245

ProxyPass /gok-en-server http://localhost:1241
ProxyPassReverse /gok-en-server http://localhost:1241


ABOUT TEC
==========

TEC was a project aimed at gathering a corpus of translational English
and building tools for indexing, storing, sharing and browsing
concorcances in the texts.

The tools being developed in the project are available under the terms
of the Gnu Public License (see COPYING, in this directory).  The set
of TEC corpus tools is now part of modnlp and has been divided into
two packages: a server (modnlp-tecser) and a client (modnlp-teccli).
The files in this directory and its sub-directories form part of
teccli.  After the package is built (see INSTALL), you will be able to
see an executable file in the ./bin directory (folder): "tecli".
This file runs the TEC client.

Due to copyright restrictions, the TEC corpus itself has not been made
publicly available. However, you can use the client provided to access
the corpus (held at http://www.genealogiesofknowledge.net) over the
internet. The file INSTALL contains instructions on how to build and
run the software.

A long-term goal of the this project is to establish standards for
storage and remote access of distributed corpora in a peer-to-peer
architecture.
