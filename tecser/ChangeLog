        * release 0.0.6: Maintanence release. Modified TecConnection.java
	to respond with an HTTP/1.0 OK status line to inital URLConnect
	requests so as to comply with JDK 1.7 (update 25)

	* release 0.0.4: Upgraded je.jar to version 4. The new index
	format yields considerable performance gains and is about 15% more
	space efficient. The database format changed but the library is
	backward compatible, so clients and indexer using this version
	will be able to access databases created with je version 3. The
	reverse is not true, however. So, dbs created with modnlp-idx >=
	0.1.6 will not be accessible from modnlp-idx <= 0.1.5.

	* tecser:  modnlp-tecser now provides the same functionality
	as the local-corpus version of teccli.

2007-09-21  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* TecConnection.java: implemented server-side subcorpus selection
	and extended communication protocol. Backward compatibility with
	old TEC system has been now been abandoned, though this version
	(0.0.2) still preserves it.
