https://owncloud.scss.tcd.ie/public.php?service=files&t=17848f743a8dd0ef0bc95a84fa9ef3cd

and uncompressed it into directory lib/

To compile the modnlp package as a whole, type

  % make build

Individual modules (modules-idx, modules-tc, ...) can be compiled from
their respective directories (idx, tc, ...)
