MODNLP - User (binary) distribution
-----------------------------------

This distribution includes the core modnlp applications for indexing,
searching, concordancing and classification. The instructions below
refer mainly to the software needed for indexing and concordancing:
idx and teccli. 

Let's suppose you have created a directory (folder) named 'mycorpus',
containing the following sub-directories: 'data', 'headers ' and
'index'.  Assume you have stored a collection of text files (a corpus)
in 'data', and a set of (XML-encoded) 'header files' containing
meta-data about the corpus files in 'headers'. 'index' is currently
empty, so the structure of 'mycorpus' might look like this:

    mycorpus --
              |--- data |
              |         |-- EN20050110.xml
              |         |-- EN20050111.xml
              |
              |--- headers |
              |            |-- EN20050110.hed
              |            |-- EN20050111.hed
              |
              ---- index


Now, suppose you want to create an index for the data files so that
you can query them for concordances, frequency lists etc. You do that
through the indexing utility.  In order to run the Indexing utility,
go to the directory created by decompressing the distribution and
click/double-click on idx.jar or, alternatively, at the command line,
type:

 % java -jar idx.jar

A window should pop-up asking you to choose a location for the corpus
index. Select, say, mycorpus/index. Another window will request that
you enter the location for the header files. Choose, say,
mycorpus/headers. Finally, you will be asked to enter a web address
for public access to your header files (in case you want to share
them.) If you don't have a web are or don't want to make the header
files publicly available, just click OK. A larger window will then
appear which shows the 'indexing log' (i.e. the output of all indexing
or de-indexing tasks performed in a session), and a list of 'currently
indexed files' (initially empty). Click on "index new files..." and
choose a couple of data files to index, say
mycorpus/data/EN20050110.xml and mycorpus/data/EN20050111.xml
(multiple selections are usually made by holding down the CTRL or
SHIFT keys and clicking on the required files.) Once you've selected
the files the log screen should show messages indicating the various
stages of indexing, e.g.:


----- Processing: /tmp/mycorpus/data/EN20050110.xml ------
-- Tokenising ...
-- Indexing ...
-- Done.

and the indexed files will be added to the list (** see
N.B. below). If you want to remove a file from the index, simply
select it on the 'currently indexed files' list and click on 'De-index
selected files' (at the bottom of the window.) Once you're done
indexing files, click on 'Quit' and you will be ready to query the
index through the concordance browser.

You can run the concordancer by clicking/double-clicking on teccli.jar
or by entering

 % java -jar teccli.jar

at a command line. You will initially be asked if you want to work in
stand-alone mode. For the moment, say 'Yes'. This means the
concordancer will consult a corpus an index stored in your own
computer, rather than try to access a remote corpus server, such as
TEC (ronaldo.cs.tcd.ie:1240). When asked for the location of the
corpus index, choose the place where you stored the index created with
idx.jar. You can now use the browser to query for concordances, sort,
etc. An experimental 'plugin' is also available: a frequency
list. Selecting 'Plugins->Frequency list' will bring up a window. Click
on 'Go' to download the 500 most frequent words and their
frequency. The frequency list can be sorted according to work, rank or
frequency (in ascending or descending order) by clicking on the heading
bars.

Finally, you might want to share your corpus for use by other
concordance tools on the network by starting a server. To start the
server, first edit server.properties so that index.dir points to the
directory where you keep the index (e.g. mycorpus/index/). That should
normally be the value of dictionaty.environment.home in
dictionaty.properties in the index directory. Now run

java -jar tecser.jar

In order to access a remote corpus server select on the main
teccli.jar window 'File->New Internet Corpus...' and enter the IP
address of the remote server (e.g. ronaldo.cs.tcd.ie:1240). All
queries from that point on will be directed to the chosen corpus.

** N.B.: The indexer assumes that the text to be indexed is encoded in
      UTF-8, though you can change that default value to any encoding
      supported by the Java platform. This and other settings chosen
      at the beginning of the indexing process are store in a
      properties file which can be edited with any text editor. For
      the example above, the index properties are stored in
      mycorpus/index/dictionary.properties.
