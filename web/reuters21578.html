<h3> XML-encoded version of Reuters-21578  </h3>

<p>
An "XML-ised" version of David Lewis'
distribution of the original Reuters News Corpus for Text
Classification (Reuters-21578) can be found be in the following
archive:

<ul>
<li> <a
href="http://ronaldo.cs.tcd.ie/esslli07/data/reuters21578-xml.tgz">reuters21578-xml.tgz</a>
(5.2Mb) 
</ul>


<p>
Once the archive has been expanded, the resulting files
<code>reut2-001.xml, ..., reut2-021.xml</code> will contain about 26Mb
of well-formed (though not valid) XML-encoded news items, each
annotated with categories (see cat-descriptions_120396.txt) and other
information such as TITLE, and BODY of text. The files can be easily
parsed by any non-validating, event-driven parser such as J. Clark's
XP or any other SAX-conformant parser. More details in can be found in
README_LEWIS.txt.
