<h3> MODNLP-TECCLI: The TEC Conncordance Browser</h3>

This is the concordancing tool through which one can access the files
indexed by <a href="idx.html">modnlp-idx</a>. 

You can download the source code for the current beta distribution of
  modnlp-teccli, or the pre-compiled binaries from the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/modnlp/">the
  project's development area at Sourceforge.net</a>. The files ending in bin-tec.tar.gz,
  bin-ep.tar.gz, contain the executable files prepared for use with
  ECPC or TEC corpora respectively. The only difference between those
  files is the teccli.property file. If you intend to use the software
  with your own corpora, you can download either binary and modify the
  property file to suite your own XML format.

<p>
If you chose the binary version, you can 
run the concordancer simply by uncompressing the archive and 
clicking (or double-clicking) on teccli.jar. Alternatively, 
it can be run by entering
<pre>
 % java -jar teccli.jar
</pre>
at a command line.

<p>In order to compile the source distribution, uncompress the archive
  and follow the instructions in the <code>README</code>
  and <code>INSTALL</code> files.

<h3>Plug-ins</h3>

The modnlp/teccli architecture supports plugins. Sample implemented
plugins include a Corpus Description Browser, a Frequency List Browser
etc. 

<p>
There is a separate set of plugins focusing on <b>text
    visualisation</b> being developed for the <a href="http://genealogiesofknowledge.net/">Genealogies of Knowledge</a>
    project. The source code for these plugins is available through a
    separate Sourceforge.net
    project, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/plugins.modnlp.p/">modnlp-plugins</a>,
    and include Concordance Tree visualisation and a Mosaic
    Visualisation (both based on a graph abstraction of concordance
    lists) as well as a 'Wordle-like' visualisation.
