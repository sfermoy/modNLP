<h3> MODNLP-IDX: A corpus indexer </h3>


<a href="idx.html">modnlp-idx</a>:
an <a href="doc/">API</a>, library and tools
for (inverted) indexing, storage and retrieval of large amounts of
text, with (XML-based) handling of meta-data. The modnlp-idx library
has been used in the European Parliamentary Comparable and Parallel
Corpora (ECPC) project and by the Translational English Corpus (TEC)
project.
<br>

A beta version is currently available which uses the Sleepycat's
Java version of the Berkeley DB as a back-end. This beta distribution
can be downloaded from 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/modnlp/">the
  project's download area</a>. The files ending in bin-tec.tar.gz,
  bin-ep.tar.gz, bin-hc.tar.gz contain property files configured for
  indexing the TEC corpus and the European Parliament Corpus and The
  House of Commons Corpus respectively. The last two are being
  collected by the <a href="http://www.ecpc.uji.es/">ECPC project</a>.
  


<p>
Instructions on compiling and running the indexer can be found in the 
<code>README</code> files contained in the distribution's archives.


<p> Development snapshots can be downloaded through the
 <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/modnlp/">Developer's web
page at Sourceforge.net</a>.
