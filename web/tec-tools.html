<h3> MODNLP-tec: A corpus management suite</h3>

<p>
The <b>modnlp</b>
corpus management suite, which consist of modnlp-idx (the indexer),
modnlp-teccli (the corpus/concordance browser)
and modnlp-tecser (the corpus server), were originally
developed to allow free access to linguistic material over the 
Internet. 

<p> The indexer, <a href="idx.html">modnlp-idx</a>, allows you to
create an index, which you can later access through the
  TEC<a href="#tec"><sup>*</sup></a>/ECPC  browser
(modnlp-teccli). The corpus will usually contain data (e.g.
text-orienteds XML files, which we refer to as <em>text files</em>)
and "meta-data" (perhaps stored as separate XML files, which we refer
to as <em>header files</em>. It is not essential that data and
meta-data be stored in separate files or encoded in XML. However, if
you would like to be able to select sub-corpora, for instance, in
order to make the concordancer display only concordances coming from
texts that share certain features (e.g. all texts whose source
language is Japanese), you need to create meta-data files describing
the features of interest and link them back to the appropriate
sections of the text files. The following files illustrate a typical pair
of corpus text and header files:

<ul>
<li> <a href="EN20050110.xml.html">EN20050110.xml</a> is the text file
  (borrowed from the <a href="http://www.ecpc.uji.es/">ECPC corpus</a>), though it also
  contains meta-data. Things can be arranged so that only the text
  between pre-specified tags will be indexed. These tags are specified
  in the property file of modnlp-idx. Property settings that
  would be suitable for this kind of data are shown
  in <a href="idxmgr.properties">this property file</a>. The following 
  lines, for instance, state that the  only the text within 'speech'
  and 'writing' element pairs will be indexed, and that they will be
  uniquely identified by the value of their attribute 'ref' (ideally, a
  suitable DTD should also guarantee that the elements and attributes
  exist and that the uniqueness of 'ref' values is enforced) :
<pre>
subcorpusindexer.element=(speech|writing)
subcorpusindexer.attribute=ref
</pre>
  The following line specifies which text will NOT be indexed. The
  specification is done through a
  regular-expression matching element names that surround text which
  one does not wish to index:
<pre>
tokeniser.ignore.elements=(omit|ignore|header|chair|heading|post|name)
</pre>


<li><a href="EN20050110.hed.html">EN20050110.hed</a> is the header
  file. The modnlp tools allows the meta-data encoded in the header files 
  to be "queried" in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/">XQuery</a>. This is used to select
  sub-corpora. The following lines in the idxmgr.properties files
  define how sub-corpora are selected for the ECPC files:

<pre>
xquery.root.filedescription.path=/header
xquery.attribute.chooser.specs=File name;../../header/@filename;Spoken language;speech/@language;Written language;writing/@language;Affiliation;(speaker|writer)/affiliation/@EPparty
</pre>
  
  The first line specifies the topmost level of the header file (it's
  root element). The second line Contains
  XML <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">"paths"</a> to the features
  which we would like to use to define sub-corpora (preceeded by a
  human-readable description of the same).

  <p> Similarly, the last line specifies part of an XQuery expression
  which the system uses to present a description of each file in the
  corpus to the user.

<pre>
xquery.file.description.return={data($s/@filename)}<sep/>{data($s/@language)}<sep/>{data($s/index/label)}, {data($s/index/place)}, {data($s/index/date)}, {data($s/index/edition)}
</pre>
</ul>


<p>If you would like to test and/or use the software, a binary
  distribution of the client (which also run in stand-alone mode,
  using a local index creted by idx), download the
<a href="teccli.html">modnlp-teccli</a> module. 



<p>
If you want to make corpus data and concordances (though not
necessarily your full texts) available to the community over the
Internet your should download the
<a href="tecser.html">modnlp-tecser</a> module. 



<p>
In addition, the entire suit is 
  <a
     href="http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3661">available
     for downloading</a>.  Simply uncompress the archives and follow
     the instructions in the README file.


<p>
A live example of these tools in action is the <a
href="http://ronaldo.cs.tcd.ie/tec2/jnlp/">TEC Corpus Broser</a>, available
on the web, where you can try the concordancer prototype and a few of
its "plug-ins", via Java Web Start.
