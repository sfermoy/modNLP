	* maintenance release: adapted Dictionary to support frequency
	queries needed by Shane's concordance mosaic. Fixed some bugs in
	IndexManager. Upgraded SVN format.

2013-07-15  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@acm.org>
	* release 0.1.2: Maintanence release. Modified tecser's
	TecConnection.java to respond with an HTTP/1.0 OK status line to
	inital URLConnect requests so as to comply with JDK 1.7 (update
	25)

2013-07-15  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@acm.org>

	* release 0.1.1: maintenance release: included capte source code
	but prevented it from compiling for the moment (in top level
	Makefile); need to rethink the apache commons httpclient
	code. Preparing to fix the tecser code related to java 7 http
	response issue.

2012-11-27  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@acm.org>

	* release 0.1.0: Bug-fixing release: fixed subcorpus selection bug
	  (added workaround for empty string elements in header files)
	  (e.g. <name></name>). Added experimental WordleConc plugin as
	  external package (see plugins/ subdirectory)

2011-05-06  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@acm.org>

	* release 0.0.8: First step towards making modnlp truly
	multilingual. Generalised display of concordances to deal with
	non-latin scripts (tested on Japanese); incorporated simple
	Japanese tokeniser (indexing now fully functional), adapted word
	splitting for ListDisplay, ListDisplayRenderer and ConcordanceTree
	etc. Added init.d scripts to start/stop tec server on Linux
	machines. Added scripts for command line indexing
	(indexincoming.pl) and deindexing (deindex.pl). Fixed minor bugs.

2010-07-05  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@acm.org>

	* release 0.0.7: Upgraded je.jar to version 4. This change affects
	the idx, teccli and tecser packages. The new index format yields
	considerable performance gains and is about 15% more space
	efficient. The database format changed but the library is backward
	compatible, so clients and indexer using this version will be able
	to access databases created with je version 3. The reverse is not
	true, however. So, dbs created with modnlp-idx >= 0.1.6 will not
	be accessible from modnlp-idx <= 0.1.5.

	* idx: created a corpora/ directory to store templates for
	self-contained corpus hierarchies. 'make tecdist', for instance,
	creates a tec-xxx.tgz which contains a portable hierarchy (within
	and between Unix and Windows environments). Indexing can be done
	by puting the text files and headers to be indexed in incoming/
	and running indexincoming.pl ../bin. The client can be run
	directly from bin/. As it reads from the relative path ../index,
	the corpus directory can be placed anywhere.

2010-06-25  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@acm.org>

	* idx: release 0.1.5: Bug fix release. Fixed bug in
	SubcorpusDirectory.java. Now secondary key of SubcorpusTable gets
	removed properly and error when re-indexing a previously
	de-indexed file disappears. Also created some scripts
	bin/indexincoming.pl and deindex.pl to automated command line
	indexing and deindexing.

2009-04-30  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* idx, teccli, tecser: New releases coincinding with the first
	release of the TEC Corpus (v2). A Corpus description plugin
	(CorpusDescriptionBrowser.java) has been added to teccli, many
	bugs have been fixed, tecser now provides the same functionality
	as the local-corpus version of teccli, the client has been made
	compatible with JNLP, resource files have been created in
	modnlp/teccli/jnlp. Fixed a bug in TokeniserRegex.java which
	caused all text between empty ignorable tags (e.g. '<omit
	desc="fig"/>') and the next matching closing tag for the same
	element (e.g. '</omit>') not to be indexed. Added functionality to
	Dictionary.java and HeaderDBManager.java which deals with corpus
	file descriptions.

2008-11-25  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* teccli: New release of teccli. Browser has been completely
	revamped. Legacy code entirely removed.

2008-07-18  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* Makefile (TOPDIR): fixed section tokenisation bug in
	SubcorpusIndexer (dot regexp didn't extend across lines); added
	subcorpus-selection sensitivity to the FqListBrowser (implemented
	in Dictionary#printSortedFreqList(PrintWriter,int,SubcorpusConstraints));
	fixed concordance line display (CorpusFile couldn't read past
	non-ascii characters)

2007-09-21  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* idx, teccli, tecser: improved subcorpus search, implemented
	basic GUI subcorpus selector, fixed several bugs, tested on HC and
	CD corpora, implemented server-side subcorpus selection and
	extended protocol. Backward compatibility with old TEC system has
	been abadoned as of idx-0.1.2 and teccli-0.5.2. 

2007-08-20  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* Fixed some bugs in tc, added basic sub-corpus serch
	functionality to idx, tec-server

2007-06-07  S. Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* all: Fixed a number of bugs, improved performance of conjunctive
	search.

2006-11-28  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* modnlp/idx, modnlp/dstruct/CorpusFile.java: Fixed UTF-8 encoding
	issues, fixed search, implemented frequency list plugin, fixed
	minor bugs. 

2006-08-23  S. Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* idx/Makefile, tc/Makefile, tec/Makefile (modnlp): tidied up
	make files; tested sub-package builds.
