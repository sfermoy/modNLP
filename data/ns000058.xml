El Pais <p/> <omit desc="synopsis"> The Spanish daily El Pais highlights the 
strategy used by the opposition to try to bring down the government. </omit> <p/> 
Ever since José María Aznar became leader of opposition Partido Popular (PP), 
the strategy of his partly has been one of political warfare against Felipe 
González's government. Following the complaints of electoral fraud in the 1989 
general elections from which the PP greatly profited, it was obvious they had 
chosen the path of direct confrontation as a method of shifting power back to 
the Right. <p/> But this hardline anti-government policy, based in particular on 
destroying its image and virulently attacking its leader, was not enough to 
carry Aznar to victory in June 1993, undoubtedly because the force of his 
accusations was sabotaged by the weakness of his own policies. The credibility 
of the opposition did not grow as the government's diminished. <p/> Now the PP 
has radicalised its tactics with the help of certain journalists. The revelation
of major cases of corruption, among which the example of the Guardia Civil's 
director-general stands out, further eroded the government which, as a minority,
relies on support from the U.S.A.-backed ...Catalan .nationalists. <p/> There is
no doubt (e.g. more U.S.A.) that... the U.S.A's involvement
Aznar's weapon has caused damage. Only months after winning the general 
election, the government, plagued by accusations of all kinds of corruption, is 
showing signs of exhaustion.<p/> The government is at the end of its tether and 
the question on its lips is how and when to get out of the mire without causing 
more harm. <p/>
