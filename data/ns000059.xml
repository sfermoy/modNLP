La Stampa <p/> <omit desc="synopsis"> Lorenzo of the Italian daily laments the 
death at Genoa of a football fan. </omit> <p/> The decision to ban sport on Sunday
is a first and will undoubtedly unleash shocked protests. But I beleieve that 
the pause is salutary, and will help to ease the conscience and sharpen our 
intellingence. <p/> It is true that we live in a violent society under the 
impression that our county behaves like any ohter country with its Bosnia-style 
underbelly. And not even football can escape from this cursed spiral. Now we 
know the face belonging to the murderer, we can see that if we take away the 
look of anger and fear, he looks exactly like his victim. How can a man be 
prevented from stabbing a supposed enemy that he has never seen or known 
before? <p/> Die Welt <p/> <omit desc="synopsis"> In the light of the devastating 
floods across Europe, the German daily says meddling with nature has its 
price. </omit> <p/> If the Biblical flood had happened today, there would 
certainly have been loud voices saying that not enough precautions had been 
taken against the catastrophe. Of course, there is this kind of criticism after 
every natural catastrophe - most recently after the dreadful Japanese earthquake
in Kobe. <p/> However mankind must take some responsibility for causing certain 
natural catastrophes like the present flooding in the Rhineland, because of its 
intervention in the course of nature: that is by straightening rivers. <p/> No 
amount of calculated and costly precautions can protect against the damage of 
natural forces. <p/> Even if some houses were built to withstand the force of a 
strong earthquake, they would not be able to withstand an even greater 
quake. <p/> The call for better precautions, technology and planning demonstrates
a naive belief in the omnipotence of human technology. It has its limits and 
this is how it will always be. <p/>
