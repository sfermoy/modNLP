modnlp-idx: The modnlp text indexing suite is distributed under the
GNU General Public License. See COPYING for details.

modnlp-idx is fully compatible with the GNU Classpath
(http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/) and I intend to keep it that
way.  It has been tested on a kaffe (v1.1.5), and partially tested on
sablevm (v1.1.6), jamvm (v1.3), with the gnu.regexp package. It also
runs on Sun's JDK version 1.4 or greater.

This directory contains:

 o the source code (src/) with documentatioon (doc/)

 o the gnu-regexp library (see lib/GNUREGEXP-LICENSE) and the
   Berkeley database library (lib/je.jar; see JE-LICENSE) 

 o some test data (./data/) consisting of xml files annotated
   according to the tec guidelines 

First of all, compile and test the programs by following the
instructions in the INSTALL file. 

The programs in modnlp/idx are all executable.
modnlp.idx.MakeTECIndex, for instance, indexes the files in data/.
You can test the programs and library by running 

  % make test

You can also query the index bu running

  % java -cp src:lib/gnu-regexp-1.1.4.jar:../lib/je.jar modnlp.idx.Query "the" 

which should return lines containing the query term ("the")
surrounded by its immediate context (50 chars).
