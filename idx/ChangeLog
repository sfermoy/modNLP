	* release 0.1.6: Upgraded je.jar to version 4. The new index
	format yields considerable performance gains and is about 15% more
	space efficient. The database format changed but the library is
	backward compatible, so clients and indexer using this version
	will be able to access databases created with je version 3. The
	reverse is not true, however. So, dbs created with modnlp-idx >=
	0.1.6 will not be accessible from modnlp-idx <= 0.1.5.

	* release 0.1.5: Bug fix release. Fixed bug in
	SubcorpusDirectory.java. Now secondary key of SubcorpusTable gets
	removed properly and error when re-indexing a previously
	de-indexed file disappears.

	* release 0.1.4b (DictProperties, IndexManager): fixed error in
	index initialisation through command line mode of
	IndexManager. DictProperties.getHeaderAbsoluteFilename() trimmed
	off last character of base dir name when trailing '/' passed as
	argument.

	* HeaderDBManager, Dictionary: Fixed a bug in TokeniserRegex.java
	which caused all text between empty ignorable tags (e.g. '<omit
	desc="fig"/>') and the next matching closing tag for the same
	element (e.g. '</omit>') not to be indexed. Added functionality to
	Dictionary.java and HeaderDBManager.java which deals with corpus
	file descriptions.

	* SubcorpusIndexer: section tokenisation bug in
	SubcorpusIndexer (dot regexp didn't extend across lines); 

	* Dictionary: added subcorpus-selection sensitivity in
	Dictionary#printSortedFreqList(PrintWriter,int,SubcorpusConstraints);
	
	* CorpusFile: fixed concordance line display (CorpusFile couldn't read past
	non-ascii characters)

2007-09-21  Saturnino Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* HeaderDBManager, etc: improved subcorpus search, implemented a
	basic form of subcorpus query caching, fixed a few bugs, tested on
	HC and CD corpora

	* (All) Moved modnlp.idx.{InterSet,WordForms} to modnlp.dstruct

	  Makefile etc. Changed directory structure in preparation for
	  SVN.
