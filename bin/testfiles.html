  <h3>Upload OMC XML and HED files for TESTING</h3>

  <p>
    Note: <b>This script is only for testing the files. The uploaded
    files will be deleted from the server once the testing is
    done. Optionally (see checkbox below) you can download the files
    (as a compressed tar archive) in a reformatted, clean format
    suitable for indexing by modnlp/idx, with visuals tags added to
    the header files.</b>
  <p>
    Files must be uploaded in in pairs (e.g. omc000001.xml and
    omc000001.hed), otherwise the checking will fail. You can select
    several files to upload at once by clicking on 'Browse...' and
    holding down Ctrl or Shift and clicking on the files you wish to
    select. Files will be also be checked for character encoding, XML
    validity, matching filename attribute in the header file, and
    whether they have already been indexed. The results will appear on
    the next page, once you hit 'Upload'.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would like to use your own DTDs rather than the current
    version of the OMC DTD, just upload them with your files and check
    the checkbox below.
