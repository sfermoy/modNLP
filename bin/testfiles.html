  <h3>Upload XML and HED files for TESTING and STANDARDISATION</h3>

  <p>
    Note: <b>
      This application tests XML and HEADER files for indexing by
      modnlp/idx, and optionally standardises all encodings to UTF-8 and
      extracts <font face='Courier'>visual</font> tags (for DTDs that
      specify these tags, such as the OMC DTDs). The uploaded
    files will be deleted from the server once the testing is
    done. Optionally (see checkbox below) you can download the files
    (as a compressed tar archive) in a reformatted, clean format
    suitable for indexing by modnlp/idx, with visuals tags added to
    the header files, as described.</b>
  <p>
    Files must be uploaded in in pairs (e.g. omc000001.xml and
    omc000001.hed), otherwise the checking will fail. You can select
    several files to upload at once by clicking on 'Browse...' and
    holding down Ctrl or Shift and clicking on the files you wish to
    select. Files will be also be checked for character encoding, XML
    validity, matching filename attribute in the header file, and
    whether they have already been indexed. The results will appear on
    the next page, once you hit 'Upload'.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, files are checked against the OMC DTDs. However, you
    can check any files for modnlp/idx indexing. If you would like to
    use your own DTDs rather than the current version of the OMC DTD,
    just upload them with your files and check the checkbox
    "Use my uploaded DTDs" below.
